# Madzera — Database Security Test Results

## Test Environment

- Project: Madzera
- Database: Supabase PostgreSQL
- Environment: Development
- Test data: Synthetic
- Execution method: Supabase SQL Editor
- Initial execution date: 8 October 2026

## Automated SQL Test Execution Results

### AUTH-01 — Authentication Identity Mapping

**Status:** PASS

**Execution date:** 8 October 2026

**Test file:** `002_auth_identity_test.sql`

**Objective:** Verify that Sarah Mitchell's Madzera employee record is active, belongs to NorthStar Customs Ltd, and links to an existing Supabase Authentication identity.

**Reported SQL output:**

| test_id | result | matching_employee_records |
|---|---|---|
| AUTH-01 | PASS | 1 |

**Interpretation:**

The database query returned one matching employee record and satisfied the authentication identity mapping assertions.

**Limitations:**

- Executed using the privileged Supabase SQL Editor.
- Does not demonstrate successful browser login.
- Does not test authentication tokens or session expiry.
- Does not establish production authentication security.

### RLS-01 — Own-Organisation Employee Visibility

**Status:** PASS

**Execution date:** 8 October 2026

**Test file:** `003_rls_employee_visibility.sql`

**Objective:** Verify that Sarah Mitchell's simulated authenticated session can read the four expected NorthStar Customs employee records through PostgreSQL Row Level Security.

**Reported SQL output:**

| test_id | result | visible_employee_count |
|---|---|---|
| RLS-01 | PASS | 4 |

**Interpretation:**

The SQL assertion returned PASS. Exactly four employee records were visible, and all four expected NorthStar employee email addresses matched.

The synthetic database also contains Daniel Brooks, an employee belonging to HarbourBridge Customs Ltd. His record was not visible to Sarah under this test.

**Limitations:**

- Executed using a simulated authenticated PostgreSQL session.
- Does not establish successful login through a real application.
- Does not test INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE permissions.
- Does not establish complete tenant isolation across all database tables.


## Pending Executable Tests

- RLS-02 — Unlinked identity access denial
- RLS-03 — Cross-organisation employee isolation
- RLS-04 — Own-organisation customer visibility
- RLS-05 — Cross-organisation customer isolation
- RLS-06 — Own-organisation case visibility
- RLS-07 — Cross-organisation case isolation

## Evidence Notes

Results are based on executed SQL and observations reported during development.

Passing these tests does not establish production security readiness or complete multi-tenant isolation.
